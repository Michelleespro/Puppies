    <p>When you think of puppies, you most likely picture cute little fluff balls with eyes you just can't resist. But beyond their adorableness, there are many fascinating facts to learn about these amazing furry friends.</p>

<p> 1. When puppies are born, they cannot see or hear. They have to use their sense of smell to get around and find their mom!

<p> </p>3. After a couple months, puppies can start to understand our body language and hand gestures. <p>

    <p><p></p>4. While puppies mostly drink their mothers milk, when they grow up they become omnivores! This means they eat all sorts of foods. They like grains, vegetables, and meats. Most dog food that you buy in a store includes all three!

    <p> </p><p>5. Puppies are considered to be “adult” dogs when they turn one year old. A dog that is one year old is about fifteen years old in human years. We would still consider that a teenager! </p>
